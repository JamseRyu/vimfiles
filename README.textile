h1. Vim

It is recommended that you use gVim in either Windows or Linux and MacVim for Mac. Download from:

* (Windows) http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc (gvim72.exe)
* (Mac) http://code.google.com/p/macvim/downloads/list (snapshot-52)


h1. Usage

Troubleshoot: Because of the large amount of submodules, if you ever have any trouble after pulling from the repository, it will be easier to just back up your old .vim folder and just git clone a new version.

Clone this repo into your home directory either as .vim (linux/mac) or vimfiles (Windows). Such as:

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/lucascaton/vimfiles.git ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim</code></pre>

And run this to get the snippets submodules:

<pre><code>git submodule init
git submodule update</code></pre>

Now, just copy (or create a symlink) the .vim/vimrc file as .vimrc (Mac OSX/Linux) or copy as _vimrc (Windows) in your home directory. In Mac OSX and Linux, the easiest thing to do is:

<pre><code>ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc</pre></code>


h2. About MacVim

If you are using MacVim, open the preferences (cmd+,) and in the Advanced tab, check the "Use experimental renderer" option.


h2. Help Tags

At first usage of vim, type ":" while in command mode and execute:

  Helptags

This will make the plugins documentations available upon :help


h2. Fonts

Monaco is for Mac, Consolas is for Windows. Under Linux better try "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono".
