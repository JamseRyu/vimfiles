h1. Vim

It is recommended that you use gVim in either Windows or Linux and MacVim for Mac. Download from:

* (Windows) http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc (gvim72.exe)
* (Mac) http://code.google.com/p/macvim/downloads/list (snapshot-52)

h1. Usage

Troubleshoot: Because of the large amount of submodules, if you ever have any trouble after pulling from the repository, it will be easier to just back up your old .vim folder and just git clone a new version.

Clone this repo into your home directory either as .vim (linux/mac) or vimfiles (Windows). Such as:

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/lucascaton/vimfiles.git ~/.vim</pre></code>

Then 'cd' into the repo and run this to get the snippets submodule:

<pre><code>git submodule init
git submodule update</code></pre>

Now just copy (or symlink) the .vim/vimrc file as .vimrc (Mac/Linux) or copy as _vimrc (Windows) in your home directory. In Mac and Linux, the 
easiest thing to do is:

<pre><code>ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc</pre></code>

If you already have a custom .vimrc file, append the following lines to load everything else along with your personal hacks:

<pre><code>source ~/.vim/vimrc      "linux
source ~/vimfiles/vimrc  "windows</code></pre>

h2. Help Tags

At first usage of vim, type ":" while in command mode and execute:

  call pathogen#helptags()

This will make the plugins documentations available upon :help

h2. Fonts

Monaco is for Mac, Consolas is for Windows. Under Linux better try "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono".
